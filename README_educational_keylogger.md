# Educational Keyboard Monitoring Demo — README

**Project name:** Keyboard Monitoring (Educational Demo)  
**Author:** Lucky Sinha  
**Intended use:** Educational demonstration for cybersecurity coursework — SAFE sandbox only.

## ⚠️ Safety & Legal Notice (Read first)
This repository and binary are provided **strictly for educational, research, and defensive purposes**. Do **not** run, distribute, or install this program on systems you do not own or without explicit, informed consent from the system owner. Deploy only in an isolated environment (virtual machine, disposable lab machine, or container). Misuse of monitoring software may violate privacy laws and institutional policies.

---

## Project Description
This project demonstrates high-level concepts behind keyboard input monitoring for the purpose of teaching detection, prevention, and secure coding practices. The binary you have (`keylogger.exe`) is included as a study artifact. The README intentionally avoids detailed instructions that would facilitate covert data collection or persistence on production systems.

**Learning goals:**
- Understand how input-capture tools can be implemented at a high level.
- Practice static and dynamic analysis techniques to identify suspicious binaries.
- Learn defensive controls and mitigation strategies to detect and prevent input-capture malware.

---

## What’s in this package
- `keylogger.exe` — educational/demo binary (treat as untrusted sample).
- `README.md` — this file (explanatory and safety-oriented).
- (Optional) Source snippets or analysis notes — may be provided separately as allowed by your instructor.

## High-level architecture (non-actionable)
> This section describes architecture conceptually, not implementation details.

1. **Input-capture component (concept):** Observes keyboard events through OS-provided APIs or system hooks. In legitimate software this is used for accessibility tools, hotkeys, or assistive technologies.
2. **Buffering & storage (concept):** Temporarily stores captured events in memory or transient logs. In responsible tools, data is minimized and protected.
3. **Transmission (not included/disabled):** Responsible tooling should never exfiltrate keystrokes without explicit consent. This demo omits or disables any exfiltration functionality.

## How to analyze safely (recommended for coursework)
Run all analysis inside an isolated lab environment.

**Static analysis (no execution):**
- Inspect PE metadata (e.g., using `strings`, `pefile`, or dedicated PE viewers).
- Check digital signatures and file hashes.
- Compare against known malware databases (VirusTotal) — *upload only if permitted by your institution*.

**Dynamic analysis (sandboxed VM only):**
- Use a disposable VM snapshot.
- Monitor process and network activity with host tools (Process Monitor, Wireshark).
- Capture system calls using sandbox tools.

---

## Detection & Mitigation (defensive guidance)
- Ensure endpoint protection (AV/EDR) with behavior rules enabled.
- Enforce least privilege — do not run untrusted binaries with elevated rights.
- Use application allowlisting (block unknown executables).
- Monitor for suspicious hooking APIs and unexpected file writes or network connections.
- Educate users about phishing and unknown attachments.

## Suggested assignment/report outline
1. Abstract & motivation  
2. Safety and ethics considerations  
3. Static analysis findings (hashes, imports, strings)  
4. Dynamic analysis summary (behavior in sandbox)  
5. Defensive recommendations and mitigations  
6. Conclusion & references

## Hashes
> If you need a file hash for reporting, compute the SHA-256 inside your lab VM rather than on a production host.
